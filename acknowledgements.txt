I used articles on the Mozilla Developer Network to help refresh my non-library
knowledge of JavaScript and CSS since I'm more accustomed to using libraries like
AngularJS and SASS.

I used the JetBrains WebStorm IDE to help me type up the code.
I used the JetBrains RubyMine IDE to help write the code.

I used the Underscore library, as you can see in my code.

I used the jQuery library.

I used StackOverflow to try to answer questions about JavaScript injection attacks, among other research.

I used Ruby on Rails on the Ruby language for better server functionality.
